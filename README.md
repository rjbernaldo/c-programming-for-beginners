# c-programming-for-beginners
My journey in learning C.

## Source code is made into an executable via a three stage process
  - Preprocessor (#define, #include)
  - The Compiler (Takes the code and compiled it into an object code)
  - The Linker

## Notes
  - Header files defines exactly what types of arguments a functions takes and what data type, if any, it returns.
